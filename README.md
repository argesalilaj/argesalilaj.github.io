A web app that helps you track and organize your to-dos without any dependencies.

Key Features:
1- User Authentication: Register and log in using browser localStorage to keep your tasks private
2- Dark/Light Themes: Toggle between dark and light modes; your preference is saved across sessions.
3- Add / Edit / Delete Tasks: Create new tasks, click to edit their text or priority (High, Medium, Low), and remove tasks when done.
4- Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox; completed tasks are styled with a strikethrough.
5- Priority Indicators: Visually distinguish tasks by priority, and have them automatically sorted (High → Medium → Low).
6- Search & Filter: Instantly search your task list by keyword and filter by status (all/high/medium/low).
7- Persistent Storage: All tasks, user credentials, and theme settings are stored in localStorage, so your data persists even after you close the browser.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 
CSS for responsive styling and theme
Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage management
